# Workflow for creating the Score
## Score Specification
Write down the outline of the score. 
## Track Specification
Split the outline into several tracks and write detailed information about each track.
## Musical Notes
Write down the notes for the track using [denemo](http://denemo.org/). Save the resulting lilypond file and commit it to github.
## Interpretation
Create your track in ogg format and submit it to the raw data repository.
## Re-Iteration
Present the results to a test audience and use the feedback to improve the piece.
