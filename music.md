# Music creation workflow

Depending on what levels will be created, different ambiences will be used, calm or... less calm.
Each level will have colored tiles setting the mood, and blinking according to what's being played as background music.

## Tools

You may use whatever tools you are used to work with, but if possible use free and open source music composing applications if you don't find yourself limited by them.

### Score

If it is part of your workflow or feel like doing it, you may write down the score of the music, ideally in the Lilipond format, which can easily be parsed. See the [recommended editors](http://www.lilypond.org/easier-editing.html).

## Exporting and publishing

Gather all the following and send it

* directly using `git` to the [glportal_raw_data](https://github.com/GlPortal/glportal_raw_data) repository
* or to one of the team members who will put it on the repo for you

### Rendered audio / interpretation

Export the music in one of the following formats:

* **Lossless**: WAV, FLAC
* **Lossy**, *high bitrate or quality*: OGG (Vorbis), (OGG) Opus

### Score

Export the score in MIDI format. Don't bother with advanced settings or even assigning instruments to each track, this MIDI file is merely used for the creation of musical visual feedback, which anyway isn't completely automated.

If you created a Lilipond score, include it also.

### License

You are free to chose the license for the files you created, as long as you allow the music to be redistributed along glPortal. This is the minimum requirement.
Also bear in mind people may want to use your works for other projects or want to remix it. Ideally choose a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/choose/) like CC BY-SA (Attribution, Share Alike) which is a [Free Culture](http://creativecommons.org/freeworks) one, to allow this.

## Re-iterate
Present the results to a test audience and use the feedback to improve the piece.


# TODO
## Music trackers
MOD format, etc...

## Track specification

Split the outline into several tracks and write detailed information about each track.
