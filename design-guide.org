* Design Guide GlPortal
** Functionality over Realism
Look at the most advanced and realistic AAA game engine you can find. Is it still looking like a bunch of textured 
polygons? I thought so.

Our aim with the GlPortal engine is to produce an enjoyable game and not go on a wild goose chase after photorealistic 
graphics that will be outdated the second they are released.
